Smart Mimic’s devices detect unwanted shifting of your gear, uninvited presence in your surroundings or unexpected movement of your bicycle or other vehicles and notifies you instantly via the available Mimic App on your mobile phone. The product line consists of the delightfully engineered, sensor laden, intelligent Mimic GO and its companion, the groundbreaking Mimic Track. Mimiq also makes the FinestraMiner for creating their network.
